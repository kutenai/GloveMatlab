This file contains 2 different IMU datasets.
Each of the datasets consits of 6 columns.
gx, gy, gz, ax, ay, az

The movements were as follows:
First, I moved the device up and down, vertically, supposedly along the X axis.
Then I rotated the device along the long axis of the board (need to figure out what this is on the gyro/acc).
