simply copy all the .m files into a directory 'robot' 

add the directory robot to your MATLABPATH

add the directory robot/demos to your MATLABPATH


Help:

1: manual

robot.pdf is the documentation in standard Mathworks style.  It is
formatted for double sided printing which makes for a more compact
manual and saves trees.

2: desktop help GUI
from the Matlab desktop, choose help, and select the Robotics Toolbox
option.  HTML format documentation for all functions is available.

3: command line
use the help command from the command prompt, eg. help ikine


Demos:
-----

1: invoke the demo GUI
from the command prompt, >>> demos, then select the Robotics Toolbox

2: desktop menu bar
from the menu bar choose demos, and select the Robotics Toolbox

3: command prompt
from the prompt, >>> rtdemos.

Options 2 and 3 only work if robot/demos is in your MATLABPATH
